Project Overview:

NULL SCAN:
Null scans were detected based on TCP packets only.
If the flags for the TCP packet added up to 0, then the scan was
considered to be a null scan.

XMAS TREE SCAN:
Xmas tree scan were detected based on TCP packets only as well.
If the flags for the TCP packet added to the maximum possible (all 1s)
then the scan was considered to be an Xmas tree scan (total = 41)

NMAP SCAN:
Other types of nmap scans were recognized by searching for the word "Nmap" in
the payload.  The binary version of this string was also searched for.

PASSWORD LEAKAGE:
If the word "Pass" was leaked in the clear (both binary and ASCII), then
the leaked password alert is emitted.

CREDIT CARD LEAKAGE:
There were three classifications of credit card numbers:
1. XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (Highly likely to be real)
2. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Moderately likely to be real)
3. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Any set of 16 digits will cause this)

To mitigate false positives, there is a risk factor associated with each
of the leaked password formats.

XXS ATTACK:
The XXS sensor looks for the following strings:
<script> alert* </script>
<script> window.create* </script>

Either of these will be seen as a possible XXS attack and the appropriate 
alert will be output.
